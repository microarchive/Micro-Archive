## Hand Microbiome as Cultural Preservation & Social Identity
We intend to create an archival system to collect hand microbiome and create a series of food items. The presentation will be in the form of a physical and instructional kit. We hope to break away from the pathological perspective of hand microbiome, and explore the cultural and social implications of hand microbiome as an identification tool.

### Potential food items:
- Cheese
- Sourdough
- Tofu
- Soy sauce
- etc.

### Potential sampler: 
- Family (Lineage and microbiome evolution “book”)
- Chef (For professional use)
