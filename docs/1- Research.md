# Concept Research
After conducting research on skin microbiome, we are particularly interested in hand microbiome. Because it is the part of our body that has most contact with each othr and outside environment.

We learnt that the composition aside from being affected by genetics, gender, health, is also affected by our social spaces, immediate environment and lifestyle. We also see there’s a call in the scientific community to shift from a pathogen-dominated perspective and instead see hand microbiome as a dynamic ecosystem.

Outside the scientific community, we also see efforts exploring our relationship with hand microbiome in the context of food making, which is much more intuitive and visceral. Jiwon Woo’s Mother’s Hand Taste, where she collected hand microbiome from family members to ferment wine, is a great example of making this relationship clear without relying on scientific terms. 

We were inspired by Jiwon’s work and wanted to expand the scale and talk about our relationship with microbiome in a way that is accessible to an even larger audience across different cultures and contexts.
