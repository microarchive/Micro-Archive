# Human Impact
## User and Non-user
- Changes the perception of our relationship with microbiome for both users and non-users
- Changes the perception of self, family and cultural identity
- Enable users and non-users access to more personal data which may lead to more privacy concerns and issues
- May change the lifestyle or daily activities with the altered perception
  - Hygiene practice
  - Cooking habits
  - Social interactions
  - Privacy protection
  
## Scalability 
- Exists in multiple scales: affordable kit + the vault 
- Use in multiple industries: from family, restaurants to city and even culture
- Multiple use cases for different scales 
- Can be scaled/applied to various cultures: the food item in the end can be sourdough for Western culture, and Tofu/soy sauce for Asian cultures, for instance. 

## Cultural and Ethics
- Could be problematic if used as surveillance, data collection, government control: question of how to regulate the data, ownership of data needs to be addressed (Do not want to become the next 23andme) 
- Concerns about the safety of food products made from human microbiome and the notion of byproducts of human
- Is this a relevant conversation for places where they are at a stage of development where sanitary issues is a concern and hence had to adopt an antibacterial perspective in their communities
