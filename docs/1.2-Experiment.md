# Experiment Protocol
## Objective:
```scss
- To investigate and compare the bacterial adhesion properties of different materials
- To investigate the growth of pathogen on different materials
```

---

## Concerned Pathogens:
- _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7: 
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 is a serotype of the bacterial species _Escherichia coli_ and is one of the Shiga toxinâ€“producing types of _E.coli_. It is a cause of disease, typically foodborne illness, through consumption of contaminated and raw food, including raw milk and undercooked ground beef.
---

## Apparatus and instruments:
### Media:
- Petrifilm _E. coli_/Coliform Count Plate:The Petrifilm _E. coli_/Coliform Count (EC) Plate is a ready-made culture medium system designed to facilitate counting coliforms and _E. coli_

### Materials:
- Hemp
- Organic Cotton
- Bamboo
- Linen
- Tencel

### Methods: 
- Lay one hand on a agar plate and the Coliform Count Plate for 5 seconds and uses it as a control group
- With the same method, lay hands on different materials that are cut in to the same size for 5 second. 
- Flame the inoculating loop and then take samples from different material surfaces and streak on the agar plates and as well as the petrifilm _E.coli_.
- Compare the cultured agar plates and petrifilm in terms of population and morphology.

### Step 5: Transfer the microbiome to the agar plate
- 3 experiment groups
- 1 control group

### Step 7: Wait for the experiment result

## Experiment Result
As a result, all of the 7 fabric will not transfer _E.coli_. While among all, linen carries the most hand microbiome. Therefore, linen is chosen to be used in our kit.
