# Experiment Protocol
## Objective:
```scss
- To investigate and compare the bacterial adhesion properties of different materials
- To investigate the growth of pathogen on different materials
```

---

## Concerned Pathogens:
- _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7: 
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 is a serotype of the bacterial species _Escherichia coli_ and is one of the Shiga toxin–producing types of _E.coli_. It is a cause of disease, typically foodborne illness, through consumption of contaminated and raw food, including raw milk and undercooked ground beef.

## Apparatus and instruments:
### Media:
- Petrifilm _E. coli_/Coliform Count Plate:The Petrifilm _E. coli_/Coliform Count (EC) Plate is a ready-made culture medium system designed to facilitate counting coliforms and _E. coli_

### Materials:
- Hemp
- Organic Cotton
- Bamboo
- Linen
- Tencel

### Methods: 
- Collect microbiome with different fabrics  and transfer to the agar plate to count colony growth 
- Compare material properties
- Transfer the microbes containing solution(soaking fabric rubbed by hand) to the coliform petrifilm 
- E.coli detection



# Experiment
## Steps
### Step 1: Make solution for agar plate

### Step 5: Transfer the microbiome to the agar plate
- 3 experiment groups
- 1 control group

### Step 7: Wait for the experiment result

## Experiment Result
As a result, all of the 7 fabric will not transfer _E.coli_. While among all, linen carries the most hand microbiome. Therefore, linen is chosen to be used in our kit.
