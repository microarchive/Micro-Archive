## Hand microbiome collection tools 
### Concept 1: Object & Fabric
To collect hand microbiome, users will rub their hands against faric placed on an holding object. It is designed to make users feel less lab-feel and more intuitive.

We created various of forms using clay in order to test which form is the most intuitive and convenient for hand to rub against.

### Concept 2: Apron
Two pads of fabric will be placed on the apron, where users' hand can easily reached. Users will collect their hand microbiome by patting on the pad.

We didn't continue with the apron idea because after reconsideration, we realized that the experience of collecting during cooking may reduce the creditibility and a sense of ritual. 

## Microbiome transfer & storage tools
We bought different forms and sizes of utensils, and tested the most intuitive way to transfer solution and also fit into the kit.


## Kit
We used paper to prototype the kit.
