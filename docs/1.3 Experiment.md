### Step 2: Sterilize cloth and equipment

### Step 3: Collect microbiome with different fabrics

### Step 4: Transfer the microbiome to the agar plate
- 3 experiment groups
- 1 control group

### Step 5: Transfer the microbiome to the coliform petrifilm

### Step 6: Wait for the experiment result

## Experiment Result
As a result, all of the 7 fabric will not transfer E. coli. While among all, linen carries the most hand microbiome. Therefore, linen is chosen to be used in our kit.
