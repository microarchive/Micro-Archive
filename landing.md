## What is HANDMADE?
It is an archival system to explore the socio-cultural implications of hand microbiome. It comes with an interaction design to make visible our implicit relationship with microbiome.

## Hand Microbiome as Cultural Preservation & Social Identity
We intend to create an archival system to collect hand microbiome and create a series of food items. The presentation will be in the form of a physical and instructional kit. We hope to break away from the pathological perspective of hand microbiome, and explore the cultural and social implications of hand microbiome as an identification tool. Eventually, we hope this project could encourage a multi-species model in viewing our relationship with our environment.
