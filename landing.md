## What is HANDMADE?
Handmade is an archival system created to explore the socio-cultural implications of hand microbiome, and to design an interaction to make our implicit relationship with microbiome visible.

## Objective:
```scss
- A shift in understanding of hand microbiome away from pathogen-dominated concept
- Investigate hand microbiome as expression of socio-cultural identities
- Reconsider our relationship with microbiome: multi-species model
```

## Hand Microbiome as Cultural Preservation & Social Identity
We created a system to collect hand microbiome for making fermented food. The system is presented in the form of a physical and instructional kit. We hope to break away from the pathological perspective of hand microbiome, and reevaluate our close relationship with microbiome. Through this project, we hope to encourage a multi-species model in viewing our relationship with our environment.
