It is an archival system to explore the socio-cultural implications of hand microbiome. It comes with an interaction design to make visible our implicit relationship with microbiome.

## Hand Microbiome as Cultural Preservation & Social Identity
We intend to create an archival system to collect hand microbiome and create a series of food items. The presentation will be in the form of a physical and instructional kit. We hope to break away from the pathological perspective of hand microbiome, and explore the cultural and social implications of hand microbiome as an identification tool.
